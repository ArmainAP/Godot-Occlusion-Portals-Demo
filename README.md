# Godot-Occlusion-Portals-Demo
Demo project for [Godot-Occlusion-Portals](https://github.com/ArmainAP/Godot-Occlusion-Portals)

## Special thanks to
- [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) as this project would not exist as it is without it!
- [FPS Template](https://github.com/Shidoengie/FPS-template-gd4) as it is the template used for the first person demo.
